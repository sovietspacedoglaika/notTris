#score

would like to implement a more complex scoring system
currscore = 100/line cleared
scores could include duration of pressing the downkey/softdropping
back-to-back for ex tetris clears 

#highscore

would like to implement high scores, possibly stored locally in a txt-file for example,
could read from and write to, compare data and only store a limited amt of highscores

#rng

currently only random.next(1,8) bc why not works ok but nor great. would like to implement
bagtypes, aka randomising a list from 1-7 and then rendering these seven n then repeat for singlebag for example
